IT191 Assignment #1

All of the jobs require that I graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science. For the jobs that I want immediately after graduating from Illinois State University, I will need to work on my programming skills while still in school. The three jobs require one to two years of programming experience in IOS and Android programming languages. If I start spending a couple hours every day working on learning those languages as well as taking classes that will build my knowledge of backend app development, then I will be qualified for any of the three jobs. I plan to use websites such as Code Academy and YouTube to learn the different programming languages that I will be required to know for those jobs. I am also trying to get an internship at a company called Eight Bit Studios this coming summer. They are a company that mainly focuses on developing mobile applications. If I am able to get the internship, I think that it will give me a huge advantage over other applicants because I will have real working experience developing mobile applications. I will also be able to show the companies that I want to work for the apps that I helped to create while interning at Eight Bit Studios. One of the jobs requires that I have an app published in the Play Store or App Store and another one of the jobs says that having an app published in either store is a huge plus, so I will also work on creating my own app and getting it published in at least one of those stores. For the jobs that I want five to eight years after graduating from Illinois State University, I will need to successfully get a job similar to one of the three jobs that I want immediately after graduating from Illinois State University. Once I work at that job for five years then I will have enough work experience to get one of the jobs that I want five to eight years from now. I will also need to expand my programming knowledge as well as other general computer science knowledge in order to meet the job requirements for those jobs.
